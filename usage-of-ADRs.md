# Architectural Decision Record (ADR): Adoption of ADRs within a regulated industry

## Context

### Problem Statement
In the a heavily regulated industry, making informed architectural decisions is critical to maintaining robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. However, without a formalized process for documenting these decisions, we face challenges such as inconsistency, lack of transparency, and difficulty in tracking the rationale behind architectural choices.

### Background
Regulated industries, or any industry, requires a structured approach to documenting architectural decisions to ensure alignment with business goals, regulatory compliance, and best practices. By adopting a formal process for creating and maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), we can address these challenges and improve the overall quality and consistency of our architectural practices.

## Decision

### Summary
We will adopt the practice of creating and maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions within our projects. This practice will provide a structured and transparent way to capture the context, decision drivers, considered options, and rationale behind each architectural decision.

### Scope
This decision applies to all architectural decisions made across all projects within the organization. It encompasses decisions related to technology selection, design patterns, system architecture, and any other significant technical choices.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Transparency**: Enhances visibility into the decision-making process, allowing all stakeholders to understand the rationale behind architectural choices.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures a standardized approach to documenting decisions, reducing ambiguity and miscommunication.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitates knowledge sharing and onboarding by providing a documented history of architectural decisions.
4. **Accountability**: Increases accountability by clearly documenting who made each decision and why.
5. **Alignment with Best Practices**: Supports the adoption of best practices by providing a structured framework for evaluating and documenting decisions.

## Considered Options
1. **Adopting ADRs**: Implementing a formal process for creating and maintaining ADRs for all significant architectural decisions.
2. **Ad-Hoc Documentation**: Continuing with the current ad-hoc and inconsistent approach to documenting decisions.
3. **Tool-Based Documentation**: Using specialized tools for documenting architectural decisions without a standardized format like ADRs.

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Transparency**: Provides clear visibility into the decision-making process, helping stakeholders understand the context and rationale.
2. **Improved Consistency**: Ensures a standardized approach to documenting decisions, reducing ambiguity and improving communication.
3. **Facilitates Knowledge Transfer**: Documents the history of decisions, making it easier for new team members to understand past choices and the current architecture.
4. **Supports Accountability**: Clearly records who made each decision and the reasoning, increasing accountability.
5. **Alignment with Best Practices**: Encourages the use of a structured framework for evaluating and documenting decisions, promoting best practices in architecture.

## Drawbacks
1. **Initial Effort**: Requires an initial investment of time and effort to train teams and establish the ADR process.
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing effort is needed to maintain and update ADRs as decisions evolve and new information becomes available.
3. **Resistance to Change**: Teams may initially resist adopting a new documentation process, requiring change management efforts.

## Architecture Details

### Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Ensure that all ADRs are written in a clear and understandable manner.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure and format for all ADRs.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that ADRs are easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
- **Traceability**: Maintain a traceable history of architectural decisions, including the context and rationale behind each decision.

### Implementation Strategy
- **Standardized Template**: Develop and document a standardized template for ADRs, ensuring consistency across all projects.
- **Training**: Provide training sessions and resources for development teams to understand the importance and process of creating ADRs.
- **Tooling**: Utilize tools that facilitate the creation, storage, and management of ADRs, such as version control systems and documentation platforms.
- **Review Process**: Establish a review process for ADRs to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with organizational goals and best practices.
- **Incremental Adoption**: Start with new projects and progressively incorporate ADRs into existing projects.

### Integration Considerations
- **Legacy Systems**: Plan and execute the integration of ADRs with existing documentation practices during refactoring.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and update ADRs to ensure they accurately reflect the current state of the architecture and decision-making process.
- **Alignment with ADRs**: Ensure that the adoption of ADRs complements and supports the principles and practices outlined in our other ADRs, such as DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and C4 Modeling.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning**: Assess current documentation practices and develop a detailed plan for ADR adoption.
2. **Phase 2: Training and Tooling Setup**: Provide training and set up necessary tooling to support the creation and management of ADRs.
3. **Phase 3: Incremental Adoption**: Begin using ADRs in new projects and incrementally create ADRs for existing systems.
4. **Phase 4: Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and refine ADRs based on feedback and evolving project needs.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Ad-Hoc Documentation**: Rejected due to the lack of standardization and the potential for inconsistent and unclear documentation.
2. **Tool-Based Documentation**: Considered but not chosen due to the lack of a standardized format like ADRs, which is crucial for consistency and clarity.

## Decision Outcome

### Expected Results
- **Transparency**: Achieve greater visibility into the architectural decision-making process.
- **Consistency**: Establish a standardized approach to documenting architectural decisions.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate knowledge transfer and onboarding through well-documented ADRs.
- **Accountability**: Increase accountability by clearly documenting the rationale behind decisions.

### Review and Evaluation
The decision will be reviewed six months after implementation to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments based on feedback and performance metrics.

## Review Date
